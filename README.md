# **Live Burglar Detection Using Deep Learning**

This project implements a **real-time burglar detection system** using a pre-trained **Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)** model for object detection. The system processes live video feeds to identify potential burglars or intrusions and raises alerts when specific objects (e.g., humans) are detected in restricted areas.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Real-Time Video Stream**
The system captures live video feeds from a connected camera or video stream:
- The video is processed frame-by-frame in real-time.
- Each frame is passed to the detection pipeline for analysis.

---

### **2. Object Detection**
The core of the project is the **SSD model**, which is designed for real-time object detection:
- The model identifies and localizes objects in each frame by outputting:
  - **Bounding Boxes**: Indicating the location of detected objects.
  - **Class Labels**: Identifying the type of objects (e.g., "person").
  - **Confidence Scores**: Indicating the likelihood of correct detection.
- The system focuses on detecting humans (or specific objects of interest) to flag unauthorized presence.

### **3. Intrusion Detection**
When the SSD model detects a person in restricted areas:
1. **Alert Generation**:
   - The system raises an alert (e.g., an on-screen message, audio notification, or an API trigger).
2. **Logging Events**:
   - The detection event, including timestamps and bounding boxes, is logged for future analysis.
3. **Frame Annotation**:
   - Detected objects are highlighted in the video stream with bounding boxes and labels.

---

### **4. Outputs**
- **Real-Time Annotated Video**:
   - The live video stream displays bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
- **Event Logs**:
   - Each detection event is logged with details such as time, object class, and confidence score.
- **Alerts**:
   - Alerts are triggered when specific conditions (e.g., human detection in restricted areas) are met.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Detection**: The SSD model processes video frames in real-time for instantaneous detection.
- **Accuracy**: The pre-trained SSD model is fine-tuned for detecting people with high precision.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to detect other objects or integrate with alarm systems.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Input**:
   - A live video feed from a camera.
2. **Processing**:
   - The SSD model detects humans in the frame and evaluates confidence scores.
3. **Output**:
   - Annotated video feed with bounding boxes and alerts for detections.

---

### **Example Use Case**
- **Input Video**:  
   A camera captures live footage from a restricted area.
- **Detection**:  
   The SSD model detects a person entering the area.
- **Output Video**:  
   The live feed displays bounding boxes around detected persons with an alert notification.

### **Applications**
- **Home Security**: Detect unauthorized intrusions in private properties.
- **Surveillance Systems**: Monitor restricted zones in real-time.
- **Industrial Safety**: Track unauthorized personnel in hazardous zones.
